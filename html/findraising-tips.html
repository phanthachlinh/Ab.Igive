    <h4>1. Get the ball rolling.</h4>
    <p>Nobody likes to be first. That’s why it’s always a good idea to get your fundraising off to a good start by making the first contribution. This will make others more likely to get involved.</p>

    <h4>2. Add your WHY in the email.</h4>
    <p>We’ve put together an email template you can download to help you start. The most important thing you can add to this message is why you are fundraising. Let your family and friends know why this matter to you, that’s what they care about most!</p>

    <h4>3. Start with your close contacts.</h4>
    <p>It’s always best to start by emailing your close contacts because they are the most likely to donate. Try sending some quick personal messages to your inner circle to build up some momentum. Then use the email template you customized to reach all of your other contacts.</p>

    <h4>4. Now move to social media.</h4>
    <p>Once you’ve sent your first batch of emails out, it’s time to turn to social media. One of the best strategies to use on both Facebook and Twitter is tagging and thanking people that have already donated while you are asking for new donations. This spreads your message further and lets the people you are asking know that people are already getting behind you.</p>

    <h4>5. Reengage with email.</h4>
    <p>Don’t hesitate to send a few follow up emails. Emails are easy to overlook and people often open them up quickly and then forget to go back to them. Use email to keep people up to date with your progress as you hit different milestones (50% raised, 75% raised, etc.) and ask supporters to help you hit the next milestone.</p>

    <h4>6. Continue thanking and updating.</h4>
    <p>As more of your network gets behind you, keep thanking them on social media and make sure you continue to share your progress towards your goal.</p>
